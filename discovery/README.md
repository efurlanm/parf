*2024-04-30*

This repository contains the code, data, manuscript, and other files used in the research entitled "Data-driven Parameter Discovery of One-dimensional Burgers' Equation Using Physics-Informed Neural Network".

* `Burgers-1D-Discovery-PINN-r240426.ipynb` - this Notebook was used to build the comparision table. Note: the graphics are wrong.
* `Burgers-1D-Discovery-PINN.ipynb` - this Notebook was used only to get the correct graphics.
* `Burgers-Exact-Solution.ipynb` - Notebook used to generate the dataset.
* `Burgers-1D-Discovery-Numerical.ipynb` - Notebook containing discoveries using traditional numerical methods.

The work also used part of the material available in the repository <https://github.com/efurlanm/425>.
